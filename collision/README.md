>construct a application simulating moving sphere, 
with:
* initial mass & size & vector and position input;
* anytime vector change or acceleration (default=0, leave an interface for force-act) input;
*  realtime acceleration & vector & position output;
*  collison test & performed;
*  all the I/O should have a GUI interface;
*  default system is 3D-based;

>Team work:
* H.Z will give all dynamic functions used and so with a class defination(qi shi ye mei duo shao ni men dong de);
* ly & slipper work on algorithm & coding;
* Y.G. work on GUI;

>Deadline:
* backgroud program should be finished in this week.(it's a easy problem).
