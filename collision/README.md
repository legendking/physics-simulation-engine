Framework for first-week task:
construct a application simulating moving sphere, 
with:
	    initial mass & size & vector and position input;
	    anytime vector change or acceleration (default=0, leave an interface for force-act) input;
	    realtime acceleration & vector & position output;
	    collsion test & performed;
	    all the I/O should have a GUI interface;
	    default system is 3D-based, but leave an interface for high-dimension  system;

Team work:
H.Z will give all dynamic functions used and so with a class defination(qi shi ye mei duo shao ni men dong de);
ly & slipper work on algorithm & coding;
Y.G. work on GUI;

Deadline:
backgroud program should be finished in this week.(it's a easy problem).

Thank you all & good luck.
